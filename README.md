## Definition
The main goal of the application is to create a appointment system for the patients who apply to hospitals in regard
to their medical needs. Application provides the central substructure and the interface, required to assist personnel
of healthcare services and the patients who request the service to use their time and energy more efficiently, reduce
the cost and the duration during the process of healthcare service, lower the queues of patients, access identity
information of patients and the past healthcare services taken by patients at any time.

## How the Application Works?
In the application, people who request a healtcare service, makes an online appointment or request an appointment
on phone through operators. The application, due to being a project/assaignment and the time constraints will
cover only the appointments requested through an operator.

The operator will decide the appropriate depertmant for the patient and their complaints, create an appointment
for a convenient time with an convenient doctor who is assigned to the decided department and inform the patient
in regard to their appointment. During the examination of the patient, the doctor will be able to see the patientâ€™s
past inspections and enter the diagnoses and the prescription into the system.
